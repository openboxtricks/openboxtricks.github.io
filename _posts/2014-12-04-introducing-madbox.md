Madbox is my new favourite distribution.

>Madbox GNU / Linux is a distribution based on Ubuntu with Openbox as a window manager.

###Discovering Openbox

I finally moved to running _GNU/Linux_ exclusively with _Lubuntu 
12.04_.

_Lubuntu_ is an official Ubuntu spin running the LXDE 
desktop.  LXDE uses _openbox_ as its window manager.  I found myself 
tweaking and essentially stripping it down to purer openbox

###Enter Madbox

_Madbox_ is a Belgian non-official spin of Ubuntu built with openbox.  It
is very similar to _crunchbang linux_ (which is now based on Debian Stable
rather than Ubuntu).

If you are familiar with _Ubuntu_ and want to try _openbox_ then _Madbox_ 
is a great place to start.  The livecd gets you up and running with 
a good looking desktop, the _tint2_ taskbar, a nicely configured _openbox menu_ 
and an attractive _conky_ displaying the time and date.
